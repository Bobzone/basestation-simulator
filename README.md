# basestation-simulator

This is a Spring Boot + Vaadin 8 project that was meant to visualise generation of requests from few Mobile Stations to a given Base Station.

Simulation works as follows:
1. Once it starts 1 base station is generated with 8 mobile stations
2. Every x seconds given mobile station generates a request to the base station
3. Base station has a number of channels, which may be free or occupied. Channel is free when there is no call happening on it (no request is being processed already).
4. If all channels are already occupied basestation will queue the requests and will process them once any channel goes free.

You, as the simulation master, are asked to provide three parameters:

* Lambda - parameter for getting a random number from the Poisson distribution. This number is then used to estimate the interval between requests generated by Mobile Station. This can be translated to an end user asking for a call.
* Variation, Mean - parameters for getting a random number from Normal distribution. This number is used to estimate the length of call once call starts.
