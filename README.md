# basestation-simulator

This is a Spring Boot + Vaadin 8 project that was meant to visualise generation of requests from Mobile Stations to a given Base Station.

After running the app you are asked to provide three parameters that are essential for setting the time in between incoming requests and the overall length of a call that will occur, when BaseStation establishes allows for the call.
